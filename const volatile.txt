In C programming, `const` and `volatile` are type qualifiers that can be used to modify the behavior of variables. When used together, they create a `const volatile` qualifier, which has specific usage scenarios.

The `const` qualifier is used to indicate that the value of a variable is read-only and cannot be modified once it is initialized. This helps prevent unintended modification of variables and improves code safety. For example:
```
const int x = 10;
```
In the above example, the variable `x` is declared as a constant integer and initialized to the value 10. Any attempt to modify the value of `x` will result in a compilation error.

The `volatile` qualifier is used to indicate that the value of a variable can be changed by external factors, such as hardware or other threads. This helps ensure that the variable is always up-to-date and accurate. For example:
```
volatile int y = 0;
```
In the above example, the variable `y` is declared as a volatile integer, which indicates that its value can be changed by external factors, such as a hardware interrupt. This helps ensure that any code that relies on the value of `y` is always working with the latest value.

When used together, the `const volatile` qualifier indicates that the variable is both read-only and can be changed by external factors. This combination is particularly useful when working with hardware registers, where the value of a register can be read but cannot be modified by the software. For example:
```
volatile const unsigned int * const pReg = (unsigned int *) 0x12345678;
```
In the above example, `pReg` is a constant pointer to a volatile unsigned integer, which indicates that the memory location pointed to by `pReg` is both read-only and can be changed by external factors, such as hardware. This is a common scenario when working with hardware registers.

In summary, the `const volatile` qualifier is used to create variables that are both read-only and can be changed by external factors. This is particularly useful when working with hardware registers or other external systems where the value of a variable needs to be read but cannot be modified.
